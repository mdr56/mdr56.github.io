Hello, I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. I have previously obtained my Ph.D in Biostatistics from the University of Pittsburgh preceded by M.S. and B.S. in Applied Statistics from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. The focus of my research is in developing and applying machine learning algorithms to high-dimensonal genomics data. During my Ph.D., I worked as a Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) where I have gained extensive experience in working with collaborators from a wide range of research background. 


## Research Interest:

- Machine learning
- Bayesian Hierarchical modeling
- Variable selection in high-dimensional data
- Analysis of genomics data (genetical data, transcriptomics, proteomics, methylation data, etc.)
- Exploring new area of research in clinical trials, spatial statistics, survival analysis, etc.

## Research Projects

- **Meta-analytic framework using model-based clustering approach in multiple transcriptomic studies with covariate adjustment :** Unsupervised machine learning remains an important role identifying disease subtypes. The aim of this project is to extend the meta-analytic framework to sparse K-means to a meta Gaussian mixture model framework. This extension allows incorporation of information from clinical variables to control for extraneous source of variability as well consider the gene-gene dependence in an unified model.
