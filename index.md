Hello, I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. I have previously obtained my Ph.D in Biostatistics from the University of Pittsburgh preceded by M.S. and B.S. in Applied Statistics from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. The focus of my research is in developing and applying machine learning algorithms to high-dimensonal genomics data. During my Ph.D., I worked as a Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) where I have gained extensive experience in working with collaborators from a wide range of research background. 


## Research Interest:

- Machine learning
- Bayesian Hierarchical modeling
- Variable selection in high-dimensional data
- Analysis of genomics data (genetical data, transcriptomics, proteomics, methylation data, etc.)
- Exploring new area of research in clinical trials, spatial statistics, survival analysis, etc.

## Research Projects

# Meta-analytic framework using model-based clustering approach for identifying subtypes in multiple transcriptomic studies with covariate adjustment
